This is a simple Grails application that maintains a list
of Albums, Artists and Tracks.  This project is a community
experiment.  You are encouraged to fork the project and
add something interesting to the application.  No contributions
are too small or too large.  Send a pull request with your
changes.

The project currently requires grails 1.1 beta 2, which
may be downloaded from http://grails.org/Download.

I hope you enjoy contributing.
